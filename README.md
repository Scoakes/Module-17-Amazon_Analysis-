# Module-17-Amazon_Analysis-

##Overview
Jennifer has asked us to analyze another larger dataset that consists of written reviews by the paid member of the Amazon Vine team. We are given access to databases with over 50 product types, we must pick one and use PySpark to perform ETL by connecting to an AWS RDS and load the transformed data into and SQL database. Then we will analyze the transformed data to determine if there is bias in the reviews and finally summarize our findings.
